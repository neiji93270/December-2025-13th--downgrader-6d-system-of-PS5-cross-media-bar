//we can use six parameters for several rows of the message model between hd and cpu and add UI/UX models parameters to crack. But to crrack too,
//we need to use ciphers oon preprocessing datas which would fill the messages model or models. Then, if we use clusters alhebra, we can omit
//first messages of the cpu to hd. So the hd is secured but not fullfilled. The cryptographic singals become easier in latent space
//but not topologies. So we have to send an hidden network by collaborative messages between servers and hosts.
